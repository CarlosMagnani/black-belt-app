# Data Model — BlackBelt MVP

Simple relational model. Every table gets `created_at`, `updated_at`. Audit-sensitive tables get `performed_by`.

- May own one `Academy` (if owner)

**Constraints:**
- Email must be unique across all users
- Password hash is never exposed via API

| created_at | timestamp | |
| updated_at | timestamp | |

**Relationships:**

- Has many `BeltProgressionEvent` (history log)

**Constraints:**
- Students cannot modify their own belt — `changed_by` must be an owner or professor
- degree is 0–4
- Belt order: white → blue → purple → brown → black → coral → red
- `approved_classes_at_level` resets to 0 on belt or degree advance

---

**Constraints:**
- Immutable — never update or delete these records

---

## ClassSchedule

**Purpose:** Defines recurring or one-off classes at the academy.

| Field | Type | Notes |

| instructor_id | UUID | FK → User.id (a professor or owner) |
| is_active | boolean | Soft delete / pause |
| created_at | timestamp | |

- `reviewed_by` must not be the same user as the student — enforced server-side
- `reviewed_by` must have role `professor` or `owner` in the academy
- One check-in per student per class per date (unique constraint)
- Only `approved` check-ins count toward belt progression
- `rejected` check-ins must not count

---

## MembershipPlan

**Purpose:** Defines a payment plan offered by the academy (price, period). Not the subscription itself.

| Field | Type | Notes |

| name | string | e.g. "Monthly", "Quarterly" |

| currency | string | e.g. "BRL" |
| period_days | integer | e.g. 30, 90, 365 |
| is_active | boolean | Owner can deactivate plans |
| created_at | timestamp | |
| updated_at | timestamp | |

**Relationships:**
- Belongs to one `Academy`
- Has many `MembershipSubscription`

**Constraints:**

- price_cents must be a positive integer

---

## MembershipSubscription

**Purpose:** Links a student to a specific plan. Tracks their subscription status.

| plan_id | UUID | FK → MembershipPlan.id |
| status | enum | `active`, `overdue`, `cancelled` |
| started_at | date | |
| expires_at | date | |
| created_at | timestamp | |
| updated_at | timestamp | |

**Relationships:**
- Belongs to one `AcademyMember`
- Belongs to one `MembershipPlan`

**Constraints:**
- Payment processing is out of scope for MVP — status is managed manually by the owner
- One active subscription per student per academy (enforce in application logic)

---

## Belt Progression Algorithm

This is the business rule encoded in the data model:

```
approvedClasses = COUNT(CheckIn WHERE student_member_id = X AND status = 'approved')
approvedClassesAtCurrentLevel = approved_classes_at_level on StudentBelt

Every 24 approved classes at the current level → advance one degree
When degree reaches 4 → advance to next belt with degree = 0

Belt order: white(0) → blue(1) → purple(2) → brown(3) → black(4) → coral(5) → red(6)
```

The `approved_classes_at_level` field resets to 0 on each degree or belt advancement.

This calculation happens in the use case layer, not in the database.
